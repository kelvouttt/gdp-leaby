# Life Expectancy and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Analysis
In this portfolio project, I am analyzing the life expectancy and GDP analysis with the dataset from WHO and World Bank respectively. In the attempt of this analysis, I am trying to answer the question if there is any correlation between life expectancy and economic output. Whether it moves in parallel or the opposite by visualizing the data so that it is easier to observe using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
